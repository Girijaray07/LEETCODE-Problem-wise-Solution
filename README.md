Welcome to the **LeetCode Problems and Solutions** repository! This repository is a curated collection of LeetCode problems and their solutions, organized into **categories** such as Arrays, Strings, and more. Each category folder contains sub-folders for individual problems, named by their titles, along with solutions written in **Python**, **C**, or other programming languages.


## Goals

- **Categorical Organization:** Find problems grouped by categories like Arrays, Strings, etc.
- **Multi-Language Solutions:** Provide solutions in Python, C, Java, and other languages.
- **Learning Focus:** Offer clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions to help others learn and improve.
- **Community Contributions:** Encourage contributions to expand and improve the collection.


### Explanation:
1. **Category Folder** (e.g., `Array`): Contains problems related to a specific topic.
